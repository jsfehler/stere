class Repeating:
    """
    Arguments:
        root (Field): A non-unique root to search for.
        repeater (Repeating): An object that inherits from Repeating.

    Represents abstract non-unique collections that repeat,
    based on a common root.

    This can be used to identify anything that not only appears multiple times,
    but also contains things which appear multiple times.

    Repeating are inherently confusing and should only be used if something
    appears multiple times, contains something else that appears multiple
    times, and is truly non-unique with no other way to target it.

    The last object in a chain of Repeating must be a RepeatingArea.
    This is because ultimately, there must be an end to the number of things
    that repeat.

    Example:

        A page where multiple "project" containers appear, each with a
        table of items.

        >>>     root=Root('css', '.projectContainer'),

        >>>         root=Root('xpath', '//table/tr'),
        >>>         description=Link('xpath', './td[1]'),
        >>>         cost=Text('xpath', './td[2]'),
        >>>    )
        >>> )
        >>>
        >>> assert 2 == len(projects.children)
        >>> first_project = projects.children[0]
